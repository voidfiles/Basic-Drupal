Notifications Nice Links: README.txt
====================================
This is a js widget for Notifications module. It will display a js overlay with Subscription links.
The original idea and most of the code come from http://groups.drupal.org/node/17779

Installation:
-------------
- After unpacking the module into your 'modules' folder you need to download the jQuery Cluetip plug-in.
- Get it from http://plugins.jquery.com/project/cluetip (version 1.0.2)
- Unpack it inside the module in a 'cluetip' folder

Notes:
------
- This is the 'use it or leave it' kind of module. Feature requests will be ignored unless coming with a good patch.
- It has been tested with Cluetip 1.0.2. Other versions are *unsupported* = issues will be just ignored.

If anyone else wants to maintain this module, just drop me a line: http://drupal.org/user/4299/contact
